## Step 3: Assigning Issues

Great job commenting on an Issue!

### :busts_in_silhouette: What is Issue assigning?

Assigning an issue to a team member allows the project manager (or any collaborator) to delegate the task to someone responsible for completing it by a specific deadline. This helps distribute work efficiently and ensures that no task is left unfinished.

_You can only assign an Issue to a team member added to your repository_

### :clipboard: Task: Assign an Issue

1. Open the issue you want to assign.
2. On the right side of the Issues page, locate the **Assignees** section.
3. Click the **Assignees** field and select the appropriate person from the list of contributors.
4. You can assign the issue to yourself for this GitHub Skill exercise.

Once assigned, the issue becomes part of that personâ€™s task list and can be tracked through their GitHub dashboard. :white_check_mark:
